pystack
=======

pystack is a cli for automatically finding the best stack overflow answers to your python errors, searching the stackexchange api or google for stack-oveflow questions, and (in the near future) running pep 8 on your code with complimentary humorous remarks.

##usage
to get pystack on your linux system, clone this repo and follow the code below:
```sh
$ ./configure.sh 	
$ pystack -h    # to see options and some examples 
```
Of course, you can set your own paths for installation. Type ```./configure --help``` for those options.

##dependencies
  -os-x or linux

  -sys (a python lib that you almost definitely already have)

  -python2.7 or later but not python3 (dists before 2.7 may work but there is no guarantee)
